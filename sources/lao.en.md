### Module 1: Adaptiveness by Design – Navigate Change and Activate Strategy
After completing this module, participants will be able to:
- **Define organisational ambidexterity** – compare organisational forms that promote or hinder adaptability, and evaluate the strategic benefits of optimising for adaptiveness.
- **Analyse structural impact** – examine how ambidexterity affects organisational design and leadership roles, and identify practices needed across all levels to enable adaptive capability.
- **Design feedback systems** – debate and create feedback mechanisms that effectively evaluate organisational adaptability and drive continuous improvement.
- **Navigate organisational complexity** – explain its nature, identify real-world examples, and demonstrate how evolutionary experiments can promote meaningful change.
- **Create adaptive transformation proposals** – design structural changes that make organisations genuinely future-ready.

### Module 2: End-to-end Organisational Design – Structuring for Business Continuity and Adaptiveness
After completing this module, participants will be able to:
- **Design adaptive product evolution** – demonstrate how to define "Products" in complex scenarios and explain how product evolution drives adaptability and improves end-to-end decision-making.
- **Accelerate organisational learning** – describe how quick feedback cycles maximise learning and formulate practical options to speed up these cycles in your own organisation.
- **Build collective accountability systems** – explain how shared responsibility for complete product development minimises coordination overhead and compare traditional structures with adaptive models.
- **Model experimentation culture blueprints** – create frameworks for fostering sustainable cultures of experimentation and innovation.

### Module 3: Aligning Strengths – From Silos to Product Accountability
After completing this module, participants will be able to:
- **Transform organisational learning** – explain the critical role of continuous learning in breaking down silos and fostering system-wide knowledge for greater adaptability.
- **Structure for optimal delivery & learning** – differentiate and design team configurations (individual, cross-functional, product) that maximise both product delivery and continuous learning cycles.
- **Enable distributed decision-making** – analyse how empowering teams with distributed decision-making accelerates organisational responsiveness and enhances adaptability.
- **Align and empower teams** – identify and apply strategies for objective-based alignment to grant team autonomy, maintain organisational direction, and streamline communication.
- **Drive continuous improvement through experimentation** – design and execute experiments to systematically enhance the quality and quantity of learning throughout their organisation.

### Module 4: Cultivating Adaptiveness through Collaborative Leadership
After completing this module, participants will be able to:
- **Master leadership that supports adaptiveness** – differentiate between Transactional, Transformational, and Collaborative Leadership, assessing their suitability for driving innovation.
